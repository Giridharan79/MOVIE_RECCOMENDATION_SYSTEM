# Movie Recommendation System 🎬🍿
Using CountVectorizer and cosine_similarity for tag-based movie recommendations. Displays movie ratings in a pie chart and identifies top-rated films. Data serialized with pickle for efficient storage.

## Overview ℹ️

The Movie Recommendation System enhances movie discovery using machine learning techniques. It employs CountVectorizer to convert movie tags into numerical vectors and computes cosine similarity to recommend movies based on user preferences and historical ratings.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and extracts tags from movie data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converts tags into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between movie vectors to determine recommendations.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Generates personalized movie suggestions based on similarity scores.
5. **Visualization**: Displays movie ratings and top-rated films to aid user decision-making.

## Benefits 🚀

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailors movie suggestions to individual user preferences.
- **Enhanced Movie Discovery**: Expands viewing options with movies similar to user favorites.
- **Improved User Experience**: Minimizes search time and maximizes enjoyment through relevant recommendations.
- **Efficient Storage**: Uses pickle for model serialization, ensuring scalable and efficient recommendation storage.
